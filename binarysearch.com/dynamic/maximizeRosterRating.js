// You are given two lists of integers ratings and ages, both of them the same length. A person i has a skill rating of ratings[i] and is ages[i] old. A team's rating is defined to be the sum of each individual ratings.
//
// Return the maximum team rating you can achieve given that you can pick anyone to be in your team as long as there aren't any two people i and j such that ratings[i] > ratings[j] and ages[i] < ages[j].
//
// Constraints
//
// n â‰¤ 1,000 where n is the length of ratings and ages
// Example 1
// Input
// ratings = [5, 4, 8]
// ages = [25, 24, 18]
